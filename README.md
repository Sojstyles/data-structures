# Data-Structures

This repository is a collection of data structures and sorting algorithms implemented in Python. I chose the most basic ones and will almost certainly add more in the future.

Feel free to use the code so long as you cite my name (a single-line comment will suffice).

Send any questions or concerns to me at edisoner@bu.edu.
