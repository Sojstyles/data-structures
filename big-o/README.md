# Big-O Cheatsheet

cheatsheet.xlsm is an interactive macro-enabled Excel file. The goal is fill in the 
time complexities for each data structure or sorting method.

The other two files (data_structures.vba and sorts.vba) contain the Visual Basic
code that enables displaying the correct answers, comparing your answers to the
correct ones (and highlighting any incorrect ones), and resetting the table.
